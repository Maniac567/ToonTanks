This Unreal 5 C++ project was part of a course on GameDev.tv in which forward declarations, constructing pawns in c++, exposing variables and components in c++, creating c++ child classes, handling input with UE5's enhanced input system,
casting in c++, spawning actors in c++, using hit events, creating a custom game mode class, and applying sounds were all learned and practiced from the online course.
